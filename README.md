# Book-Review-Website-Using-Django
I made this Website during my Summer Industrial Training from WEBTEK LABS PVT. LTD. on the 4th year of B.Tech CSE. In this website users can read about books and authors and comment on their favourite books (commenting is availabe only after register and login process) . Also user will get the buying link of books. A feedback system is also 
available.
